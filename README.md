# Angus-Rescue

### ABOUT THE GAME
---
  When Lil Angus, a young cyclop, comes home, he finds his parents are missing! He finds a letter telling him where they are kept. He must go defeat the boss and his lackeys to save them!
  
  This will be a turn-based game where Lil Angus will battle the enemy one at a time. Lil Angus (the player) will have the ability to attack, defend, or heal while the enemy will randomize between attacking and defending. If the player's health goes to zero, the game ends. If the enemy's health goes to zero, the player can move to the next stage where the enemy has a higher health/damage with the boss being the last stage. Once the boss is defeated, the player wins and ends the game.
