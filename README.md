# Angus-Adventure

### ABOUT THE GAME
---
  Angus is trying to get back home, but a bunch of baddies are in the way. Help Angus beat the evil monsters so he can go home! 
  
  This is a turn-based game where Angus will battle one enemy at a time. The player (Angus) will have the ability to attack, defend, or heal. On easy, the computer will randomly choose between attacking and defending. On hard, the computer will make choices based on what the player chooses. Once the enemy's health goes to zero, the player can move to the next stage where the enemy is stronger than the last with a total of 5 stages. Once the final stage is completed, the player wins and ends the game. If the player loses, they will be able to restart the last stage they were at
